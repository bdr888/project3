Project 3

## Film School 
Digital movie library

Use the app on Heroku: *<a href="https://glacial-basin-74523.herokuapp.com/">Film school</a>

Film School lets you create a digital library for the movies you’ve seen and want to see. You can make your own sections based on genre, director, actor, year, etc…

---

## Concept and Research
It is primarily for anyone who has trouble deciding what movie to watch.

Secondarily would be useful for film professors and students, or movie buffs who want to get a clear map of their movie universe.

#### Why do they need it? 
They need it because through user research we’ve found that most of the time when people sit down to watch a movie at home, they don’t have a specific one in mind, and they don’t really know where to begin their search.

Film school aslo helps the user discover what types of movies they like, and the relationships between them.

#### Who is the competition? 
The main competition is streaming services: Netflix, HBO GO, Amazon Prime Video.

#### What will we do better? 
I think the app will give you more control over the browsing experience, where these other services attempt to automate based on your behavior.

It will allow you to have a digital “library” of the movies you’ve seen, which the competition has very limited functionality.

It will allow you to share your section or library with friends.
